  "scene_name": "Design",
  "voiceover": "Next up, let's talk about the design of the OnePlus Open. This device features a sleek and modern design with a glass front and back, and an aluminum frame. It feels premium in hand and has a nice weight to it. Linus Tech Tips mentioned, 'The OnePlus Open has a beautiful design that feels very premium and well-built.' Similarly, The Verge noted, 'OnePlus has nailed the design with the Open. It's sleek, modern, and feels great in hand.' User comments on Flipkart are also positive, with one user saying, 'The design is simply stunning. It feels great to hold and looks very premium.' The glass and aluminum combo adds a bit of heft, and at 202 grams, it's heavier than some competitors like the iPhone 14 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S23. However, the matte finish on the back does a good job of keeping those pesky fingerprints at bay. The build quality is top-notch, with the device feeling sturdy and capable of handling a few bumps. The overall aesthetic is modern and sleek, making it a head-turner. Compared to its rivals, the OnePlus Open stands out for its premium materials and design finesse. However, the weight might be a concern for some users who prefer lighter devices. The design scores a commendable 9 out of 10, losing a point due to its weight. Let's move on to the display and see if it matches the high standards set by the design.",
