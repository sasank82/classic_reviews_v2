Xiaomi has opted for a premium combination of titanium frame and ceramic back, exuding luxury. As Linus Tech Tips aptly pointed out in their review, 'The build quality is superb, feels denser than most phones, but in a reassuring way.'  The ceramic back, while beautiful, does tend to attract fingerprints, but thankfully, Xiaomi includes a case in the box. The camera module, though large, is integrated seamlessly into the design, adding to its distinctive appeal. Several users on Indian forums like Reddit have praised the phone's ergonomics. One user commented, 'Despite its size, the curved edges make it surprisingly comfortable to hold, even for extended use.' However, some reviewers like Dave2D noted, 'The lack of a headphone jack is a bummer.' Weighing 234 grams, it's a bit on the heavier side compared to the Samsung S23 Ultra, but the weight distribution is well-balanced. Overall, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra scores an 8 out of 10 for design. It's a stunning phone with a premium feel, but the lack of a headphone jack and the fingerprint-prone back holds it back slightly.",

Reviewers like MKBHD have praised the display's color accuracy, saying, 'The colors just pop on this display. It's one of the most color-accurate displays I've ever tested.' The high peak brightness ensures excellent outdoor visibility, even under direct sunlight, which is crucial for the Indian climate.  Several users on Amazon India have commended the display, with one user stating, 'Watching movies on this phone is a treat. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deep.' However, some tech experts, like those at GSMArena, mentioned that the curved edges, while aesthetically pleasing, can sometimes cause slight distortion at the edges. Overall, the display on the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is top-notch and deserves a solid 9 out of 10.  It offers a great viewing experience with vibrant colors, smooth refresh rates, and excellent brightness, making it ideal for media consumption and gaming. The minor distortion at the edges prevents it from getting a perfect score.",

Users on forums like Reddit have also reported excellent gaming performance, with the phone staying cool even during extended gaming sessions.  However, some tech analysts have raised concerns about potential thermal throttling under extreme sustained loads. We'll have to wait for more comprehensive tests to confirm this. Comparing it to the OnePlus 11 and the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra appears to be a step ahead in terms of raw processing power.  For its exceptional performance, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra earns a well-deserved 9 out of 10.

Indian Express, in their initial impressions, highlighted the phone's ability to handle a full day of calls, social media browsing, and even some light gaming without needing a top-up. And when you do need to recharge, the 90W wired charging is incredibly fast.  Mrwhosetheboss, in his review, mentioned that the phone could charge from 0% to 100% in just under 30 minutes. That's seriously impressive! Plus, with 50W wireless charging, you have a convenient option for topping up your battery without the hassle of wires. Users on Amazon have praised the fast charging, saying it's a lifesaver for their busy schedules. Compared to its rivals like the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra with its 45W charging and the iPhone 14 Pro Max with its comparatively slower charging speeds, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra clearly has an edge in this department. This powerful combination of a long-lasting battery and incredibly fast charging makes the Xiaomi 14 Ultra a winner for users who are always on the go.

            "voiceover": "Alright, folks, let's talk about the star of the show - the camera on the Xiaomi 14 Ultra. This phone boasts a seriously impressive camera setup that's creating a buzz in the tech world. We're looking at a quad-camera system with a 50MP primary sensor, a 48MP ultra-wide lens, a 48MP telephoto lens offering 5x optical zoom, and a 12MP periscope telephoto lens with a jaw-dropping 10x optical zoom.  Reviewers like MKBHD and Dave2D have praised the camera's versatility and ability to capture stunning details in various shooting scenarios. In typical Indian conditions, expect vibrant and true-to-life colors, whether you're capturing the bustling streets of Mumbai or the serene landscapes of Ladakh.  The low-light performance has also received a thumbs-up from several tech experts. Android Authority, for instance, highlighted its impressive noise reduction and detail retention in low light, making it a great companion for capturing those magical Diwali nights. However, some users on forums like Reddit have pointed out that the camera app can be a bit sluggish at times, especially when switching between lenses or shooting in Pro mode. Now, let's put this camera to the test against its arch-rivals, the iPhone 14 Pro Max and the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. In a side-by-side comparison, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra holds its own remarkably well. Images generally exhibit excellent dynamic range and detail, particularly in daylight conditions. However, the iPhone 14 Pro Max edges ahead slightly in terms of video stabilization. Overall, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra's camera is a significant leap forward, delivering exceptional image quality and versatility. It's a strong contender for the top spot in the smartphone camera game, making it a 9 out of 10 for us. The minor performance hiccups in the camera app and the slight edge in video stabilization for the iPhone prevent it from getting a perfect score.  ",

While MIUI has often been a point of contention for some users in the past, this time around, things seem to have taken a turn for the better.  MKBHD, in his review, commented that MIUI 15 feels snappier and more refined than previous versions, with smoother animations and a cleaner overall aesthetic. The Verge also echoed similar sentiments, mentioning that Xiaomi has done a commendable job in toning down the bloatware and delivering a cleaner software experience. For our Indian users, this is particularly important. We've seen mixed reactions to MIUI in the past, with some appreciating the additional features and customization options, while others have criticized it for being overly intrusive and cluttered.  However, initial impressions suggest that MIUI 15 addresses some of these concerns, offering a more balanced approach. Navigating through the interface feels smooth and fluid, apps launch quickly, and there's plenty of RAM to handle multitasking without breaking a sweat.  However, it's worth noting that some users on the Xiaomi subreddit have expressed concerns about the presence of pre-installed apps that they consider bloatware.  While these can generally be uninstalled, it's still something to keep in mind.  Overall, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra offers a significantly improved software experience with MIUI 15. The UI feels snappy and responsive, and Xiaomi seems to have listened to user feedback by reducing bloatware and offering a more streamlined experience. However, the presence of some pre-installed apps might still be a point of contention for some users. We're giving the software experience on the Xiaomi 14 Ultra an 8 out of 10. It's a solid improvement over previous iterations of MIUI, but there's still some room for improvement in terms of bloatware management.",

While we don't have the official India pricing yet, based on its European pricing and previous trends, we expect it to launch around ₹75,000 to ₹80,000. This puts it in direct competition with other flagship devices like the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and the iPhone 14 Pro Max.  Geekyranjit, in his initial impressions video, mentioned that if Xiaomi manages to price the 14 Ultra aggressively, it could disrupt the premium smartphone segment in India.  And he's right. The Indian smartphone market is very price-sensitive, and a compelling price tag could give Xiaomi a significant advantage.  However, it's not just about the price. The Xiaomi 14 Ultra packs in a lot of value for its price tag. It's got a stunning display, powerful performance, impressive cameras, and fast charging, all wrapped up in a premium design. Several users on forums like Reddit and XDA have expressed excitement about the phone's launch in India, with many praising Xiaomi for offering high-end features at competitive prices. But it remains to be seen how well it will be received considering its high price point.  The actual launch date and pre-order details are yet to be announced by Xiaomi India.  Keep an eye out for Classic Reviews' social media channels for the latest updates. We'll be sure to share them as soon as we have them. For its potential to shake up the premium segment with its features and aggressive pricing, we're giving the Xiaomi 14 Ultra a score of 8 out of 10 for price and availability.

The obvious competitors are the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and the iPhone 14 Pro Max.  In terms of cameras, the 14 Ultra really pushes the boundaries. MKBHD, in his review, said,  'The Xiaomi 14 Ultra doesn't just have a good camera, it has a camera system that rivals professional setups.'  And he's not exaggerating. The 1-inch sensor and Leica collaboration give it a significant edge, especially in low light.  The Verge also praised the phone's versatility, stating,  'Whether you're shooting photos or videos, the 14 Ultra delivers exceptional results across the board.'  However, Samsung's S23 Ultra shouldn't be discounted. Its zoom capabilities are still top-notch, and it offers a more well-rounded software experience that many users in India prefer.  On the performance front, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the 14 Ultra trades blows with Apple's A16 Bionic in the iPhone 14 Pro Max.  Both phones are absolute powerhouses capable of handling anything you throw at them.  However, Apple's tight integration of hardware and software gives it a slight edge in everyday performance. But Android Authority did highlight that the 14 Ultra's performance is 'nothing short of phenomenal,' especially when it comes to gaming.  Ultimately, the choice comes down to your priorities and ecosystem preferences.  If you're a photography enthusiast looking for the absolute best camera system in a smartphone, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra should be at the top of your list.  But if you value a more polished software experience and a well-rounded flagship, the Galaxy S23 Ultra and iPhone 14 Pro Max are still excellent alternatives. Taking its strengths and the competition into account, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra gets a 9 out of 10 in this comparison. It might not be perfect, but it definitely makes a statement.",

Yes, it comes with a premium price tag, but when you compare it to the competition, the value is undeniable, especially for our Indian users. You're getting a device that excels in almost every area.   However, it's not without its minor drawbacks. The MIUI, though improved, might not appeal to everyone, and some bloatware persists.  The phone's size and weight might also be a concern for some. But let's be honest, these are minor compromises for a phone that delivers this level of performance and innovation.   Ultimately, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is a phone for those who demand the best.  If you're a photography enthusiast, a power user, or someone who wants the absolute latest and greatest in tech, this phone is for you.  The Classic Reviews verdict? The Xiaomi 14 Ultra scores an impressive 9.5 out of 10.  It's a shining example of what a 2023 flagship should be.",
