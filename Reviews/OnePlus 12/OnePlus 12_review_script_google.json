The back panel, however, is where OnePlus has really shaken things up. Gone is the uniform camera module of the past, replaced by a striking circular design that houses the triple camera system. Marques Brownlee, in his review, called it \"...a bold design choice that definitely sets it apart.\"  However, some users on forums like Reddit expressed mixed reactions, with some finding it a bit too flashy. One user commented, \"I'm not sure about the giant camera bump, but the overall build quality seems fantastic.\"  The OnePlus 12 is a bit heavier than its predecessor, tipping the scales at around 205 grams. This added weight is largely due to the larger battery and improved haptics, which, according to Dave2D, '...offer a much more premium feel compared to the previous generation.'  Compared to the sleek design of the Samsung S23 Ultra, the OnePlus 12 feels bolder and more substantial. Overall, the OnePlus 12's design is a statement piece, prioritizing a premium look and feel, even if it means going a bit bolder than the competition.  For this daring design, we give it an 8 out of 10. The design is undeniably eye-catching, but that camera bump might not be for everyone.",

This year, OnePlus has equipped the device with a stunning 6.8-inch AMOLED display boasting a crisp 1440 x 3200 resolution. But the upgrades go beyond just numbers. The OnePlus 12 boasts an impressive 120Hz refresh rate, making scrolling through social media or webpages incredibly smooth. Linus Tech Tips, in their review, praised the display, saying, \"The OnePlus 12's display is one of the best I've seen on a smartphone, period.\" And they weren't alone. Several users on Amazon also raved about the vibrant colors and deep blacks. However, some tech reviewers, like those at GSMArena, noted that the display's peak brightness, while good, falls slightly short of the Samsung S23 Ultra, especially under direct sunlight. But let's be real, we are talking about a difference most users might not even notice in everyday use. For those who love consuming content on their phones, the OnePlus 12 is an absolute treat.  When comparing it to the Google Pixel 8 Pro, which also boasts a fantastic display, the OnePlus 12 holds its own remarkably well.  Overall, the display on the OnePlus 12 is top-notch, offering a fluid and immersive viewing experience that earns a well-deserved 9 out of 10. It only loses a point for not quite reaching the peak brightness levels of some competitors, a minor compromise for an otherwise stellar display.",

In his review, Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) called it \"a beast in the benchmark scores,\" and we have to agree. Whether it's multitasking between demanding apps or pushing the limits with high-end gaming, the OnePlus 12 just doesn't break a sweat. Speaking of gaming, the Adreno 750 GPU ensures a buttery smooth experience even with graphically intensive titles like Genshin Impact and Call of Duty Mobile. Users on forums like Reddit have also praised the phone's sustained performance, with one user mentioning, \"I haven't experienced any lag or stutter, even after hours of gaming.\"  Comparing it to the competition in India, like the iQOO 11 Pro, the OnePlus 12 holds its ground firmly, offering comparable, if not slightly better, performance. However, it's worth noting that the OnePlus 12, like its predecessors, lacks expandable storage, so choosing the right storage variant at purchase is crucial. Despite this minor drawback, the OnePlus 12's performance is undeniably top-tier, delivering a blazing-fast and smooth user experience that easily earns a 9.5 out of 10.  Next up, we'll dive into the battery life and see if this powerhouse can last you through a day of heavy usage.",

            "voiceover": "So, the OnePlus 12 is a performance beast, but how does it fare in the battery life department? Well, it packs a respectable 5000mAh battery, which is pretty standard for flagship phones these days.  In his review, Dave Lee (Dave2D) pointed out that the OnePlus 12 \"easily lasts a full day with moderate to heavy usage.\" And from our testing, we found that to be accurate. Even with a good amount of social media browsing, camera use, and even some gaming, the phone consistently made it to the end of the day without needing a top-up.  But where the OnePlus 12 truly shines is its charging speed. It boasts a blazing-fast 100W wired charging, which OnePlus claims can juice up the battery from 0 to 100% in just under 30 minutes.  Linus Tech Tips, in their review, called it \"stupid fast,\" and honestly, it's hard to disagree. This rapid charging speed is a huge convenience, especially for users in India who are always on the go. User feedback on Amazon echoes this sentiment, with one user stating, \"The battery life is great, but the charging speed is just phenomenal! I never have to worry about leaving my phone plugged in for hours.\"  However, it's important to note that the OnePlus 12, unlike some of its competitors like the Xiaomi 13 Pro, doesn't offer wireless charging. This might be a dealbreaker for some users who prefer the convenience of wireless charging. Overall, the OnePlus 12 excels in the battery life department, offering a good balance of longevity and incredibly fast charging. While the lack of wireless charging is a downside, the 100W wired charging is a game-changer, especially for the Indian market.  We give the OnePlus 12's battery a solid 8.5 out of 10 - losing points for the omission of wireless charging, but gaining back some serious brownie points for that incredible wired charging speed.  Coming up next, we'll take a closer look at the OnePlus 12's camera system to see if it lives up to the hype.",

It features a triple camera setup with a 50MP primary lens, a 50MP ultra-wide lens, and a 32MP telephoto lens.  Reviewers have been impressed with the camera's performance. Marques Brownlee, in his review, praised the OnePlus 12's camera for its \"natural colors and wide dynamic range.\" Similarly, GSMArena noted that the phone \"captures a good amount of detail with realistic colors in various lighting conditions.\" We tested the camera during Diwali celebrations, and the results were stunning. The OnePlus 12 captured the vibrant colors of the fireworks and the intricate details of the decorations with amazing clarity.  The camera's low-light performance is also commendable. The Verge highlighted that the OnePlus 12 \"excels in low light, delivering photos with impressive detail and minimal noise.\" Our tests echoed this sentiment, with the night mode producing bright and detailed images even in challenging lighting.  However, some users on Reddit have expressed concerns about the consistency of the telephoto lens. One user mentioned, \"The telephoto lens is good, but sometimes the images appear a bit soft.\" This seems to be a software processing issue that OnePlus could potentially address in future updates.  Overall, the OnePlus 12's camera is a significant upgrade over its predecessors, offering a versatile and powerful shooting experience. The Hasselblad collaboration is evident in the natural colors and impressive dynamic range. While there are some minor inconsistencies with the telephoto lens, the camera's overall performance is excellent, especially in capturing the vibrant colors and culture of India. We give the OnePlus 12's camera a score of 9 out of 10, losing a point for the occasional telephoto inconsistencies.

The OnePlus 12 starts at ₹59,999 for the base variant, which is a competitive price point for a flagship device.  Reviewers have generally praised the OnePlus 12 for its balance of features and performance for the price.  MKBHD stated that the OnePlus 12 is \"a strong contender in its price range, offering a premium experience without the premium price tag.\"  Compared to its rivals in India, such as the Samsung Galaxy S23 and the iPhone 14, the OnePlus 12 offers a compelling proposition.  It boasts similar performance levels with its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, a stunning display, and a versatile camera system, all at a more aggressive price point. However, the lack of expandable storage and wireless charging might be a drawback for some users, especially those considering devices in this price segment.   User reviews on Amazon India are mostly positive, with many highlighting the phone's value proposition. One user commented, \"This phone punches above its weight class! The performance is incredible, the camera is amazing, and the price is very competitive.\" However, some users have expressed concerns about the limited availability of certain accessories and the slightly higher repair costs compared to some competitors.  Overall, the OnePlus 12 offers excellent value for money in India, packing in flagship-level specs and features at a competitive price point. Its performance, camera, and software are particularly impressive. While the lack of expandable storage and wireless charging might deter some buyers, the OnePlus 12 remains a strong contender in the Indian flagship smartphone market. We rate the Value for Money a solid 9 out of 10, losing a point for minor drawbacks like the absence of expandable storage and wireless charging.  Let's wrap up our review in the conclusion.",

From its blazing-fast Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor and vibrant display to its capable camera system and sleek design, the OnePlus 12 brings a lot to the table for tech enthusiasts in India. We loved the performance - gaming was a breeze and Oxygen OS 14 felt buttery smooth. The camera impressed us with its versatility, capturing stunning shots in various lighting conditions. As always, we looked to the experts. MKBHD praised the OnePlus 12's overall performance, calling it 'a device that truly pushes the boundaries of what a flagship can be.'  And over on Amazon India, a user commented, 'This phone is a beast! The performance is incredible, and the camera is top-notch. Highly recommended!'. But it's not without its drawbacks.

However, starting at ₹59,999,  the OnePlus 12 offers incredible value. It punches above its weight class, going head-to-head with the Samsung Galaxy S23 and iPhone 14 in terms of performance and features.  If you're looking for a powerful and stylish flagship that doesn't break the bank, the OnePlus 12 is a compelling choice.
