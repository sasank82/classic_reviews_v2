According to Marques Brownlee (MKBHD), 'The battery life on the Pixel 8 Pro is solid. It comfortably lasts a full day with moderate to heavy use.' Linus Tech Tips also praised the battery performance, stating, 'With the optimizations from the Tensor G3 chip and Android 14, the Pixel 8 Pro delivers impressive battery life.' Users on Amazon have reported similar experiences, with one user mentioning, 'I can easily get through a full day with around 20% battery left by bedtime.' The phone supports 30W fast charging and also has wireless charging capabilities. However, some users have noted that the charging speed isn't as fast as some competitors. On Flipkart, a user commented, 'The battery life is great, but I wish it charged a bit faster.' Compared to other flagship devices like the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and iPhone 14 Pro, the Pixel 8 Pro holds its ground in terms of battery longevity, though it lags slightly in charging speed. Overall, the battery performance of the Pixel 8 Pro scores an 8 out of 10. It excels in battery life but loses points for its relatively slower charging speed. Next, we'll dive into the camera system to see if the Pixel 8 Pro lives up to its reputation.",

This device boasts a triple-camera setup, including a 50MP primary sensor, a 48MP ultra-wide lens, and a 12MP telephoto lens. Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) praised the camera, saying, 'The Pixel 8 Pro's camera is one of the best I've used this year. The image processing is top-notch, especially in low-light conditions.' Linus Tech Tips echoed this sentiment, mentioning, 'Google's computational photography continues to impress with sharp details and vibrant colors.' Users on Amazon have shared similar experiences, with one stating, 'The camera performance is outstanding, especially in night mode. The photos are crisp and clear.' However, some users on Reddit have pointed out that the telephoto lens could use some improvement, with one user commenting, 'The telephoto lens is decent, but it doesn't match up to the primary and ultra-wide lenses.' Compared to other flagship devices like the iPhone 14 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, the Pixel 8 Pro holds its own and even excels in certain areas like low-light photography. Overall, the camera system of the Pixel 8 Pro scores a solid 9 out of 10. It delivers exceptional image quality and versatility, though it loses a point for the slightly underwhelming telephoto lens.
